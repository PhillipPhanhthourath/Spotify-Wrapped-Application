## Rules for Branches & Pull Requests:
- All branches should refer to individual user cases / tasks assigned on Trello. From these main branches, developers should make branches for themselves.
- PLEASE REMEMBER TO DO GIT PULL BEFORE MAKING ANY LOCAL CHANGES (if prompted, choose rebase as your pull option).  
- When creating PRs, please give a description of what you did in the following template:

| Information | Input |
| ----------- | ----- |
| Name(s) | *your name* |
| Role(s) | *your role* | 
| Work Description | *what you did* |  
| Issues | *brief description of issues you ran into and how you solved them* |  
| Suggestions/Improvement | *ways your feature could be improved* |
