## Rules for Issues: 
- Issues will be used to assign tasks to individuals and have an open forum for updates and asking questions.
- All issues will be created and assigned by the scrum master (Phil).
- They will follow the tasks assigned on Trello.
- They will be created using the following template:


| Information | Description |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| Title | *Task #* |
| Description | *specific part of task scrum master assigns* |
| Link to Trello Card | *developer should document process there* |
| Expected Deadline | *either Sprint #1 deadline or Sprint #2 deadline* |
